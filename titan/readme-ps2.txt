To get your sources compiled, checkout the latest PS2SDK source tree. You
will need libc, libmc, sdl, zlib, gsKit, dmaKit and audsrv. All of these are 
available at www.ps2dev.org

Flashback was developed and produced by Delphine and U.S. Gold back in 1992.
It was released originally for Amiga, which was later followed by DOS, 3DO,
Genesis, SNES, SegaCD and in 1995, for Jaguar.

It has always been considered a must-have game, but Delphine unfortunately
seized to exist, and the game is now considered Abandonware.

Cyx rewrote the engine that is running Flashback. This project, REminiscence,
is available for download under the spirit of GNU Public License. The 
elegant code design made the porting smooth. So far it has been ported to
PalmOS, WinCE and MorphOS. By using SDL, it compiles and runs on modern 
platforms, such as Windows, Linux and FreeBSD. A big 'I'm-not-worthy' goes
out to Cyx, for completing REminiscence, and making the sources available.

Cheers go out to Neovanglist, for beta testing and for shouting 'r0x0rs'
a million times over irc (I keep logs!)

And thank you, for downloading this and playing on your box. You are more
than welcome to send feedback, or just come visit everybody at #ps2dev
on freenode.
